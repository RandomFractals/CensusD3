## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ quasar dev

# lint code
$ quasar lint

# build for production with minification
$ quasar build

# run production build locally 
$ quasar serve ./dist
```

Note: this is only v0.0.1. Not an optimized package just yet. I'll trim it down with webpack in v0.0.2.
