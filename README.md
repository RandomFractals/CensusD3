Interactive d3.js v.4 maps & graphs data viz of US census data from census.gov

# USA States/Counties Choropleth Teaser

There will be lots of these kind of choropleth (intensity) maps, 
but highly interactive and broken down by state, county, and zip regions, 
with plenty of census data bars, lines, and histogram graphs using d3.js v.4.
