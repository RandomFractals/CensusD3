Interactive d3.js v.4 maps & graphs data viz of US census data from census.gov

# USA States/Counties Choropleth Teaser

There will be lots of these kind of choropleth (intensity) maps, 
but highly interactive and broken down by state, county, and zip regions, 
with plenty of census data bars, lines, and histogram graphs using d3.js v.4.

 "latest") 

Think http://datamapper.geo.census.gov/map.html but less rigid, more interactive, and user-friendly.

# In Sum

Be nice and drop me a note, if you decide to use this proto for your next.

I have not decided on the license type of this public data viz just yet,
because it's still supper rought after only 2 weeks of dev,
but it's public as of now and I plan to keep it that way.

Most likey I will adopt whatever d3.js and M. Bostock license is using.

Feel free to log issues and ping me wigh pull requests 
for the alpha v. fixes/feature requests, if you find this of some use,
and decide to fork this quicky demo app repo for your next.
